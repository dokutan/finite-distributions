# finite-distributions

An updated version of ``clojure.contrib.probabilities.finite-distributions``. Because ``clojure.contrib`` was deprecated, i extracted this library and made the following changes:
- remove clojure.contrib dependencies
- fix misplaced docstrings
- replaced deprecated functions

I consider this version to be stable.

## Usage

The library is available on [clojars](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.dokutan/finite-distributions). If you use Leiningen, add the following to your dependencies:
```
[org.clojars.dokutan/finite-distributions "1.0.0"]
```

## Documentation

The [documentation](https://clojure.github.io/clojure-contrib/probabilities.finite-distributions-api.html) of the original is still valid, but missing some items.
